We have used the OASIS longitudinal dataset from kaggle and modified it. I have uploaded the modified dataset here.

We have used KNN Algorithm  and its variants for classifying Alzheimer's disease, namely: NN, KNN and Weighted KNN.
We have used three distance metrics for comparison, namely
 1. Euclidean distance,

 2. Manhattan distance,

 3. Minkowski distance

  As for the features, we have used MMSE, eTIV, nWBV, SES and EDUC. 
  + The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a 30-point value. It is used to search for dementia and to measure cognitive impairment. A value >= 24 points out normal cognition. Value in between 19 to 23 accounts for mild, 10 to 18 for moderate and =<9 indicates severe. However, MMSE alone is not a strong feature.
  + eTIV(Estimated total intracranial volume)or ICV value is used to assess AD, Mild cognitive impairment. This feature estimates the age-related change in the structure of brain. It points to the approximate volume of the cranial cavity. 
  + EDUC stands for years of education.
  +  SES (socio economic status) values ranges from 1 to 5. 1 being the highest status and 5 being the lowest status. 
  +  nWBV stands for Normalized whole brain volume area.
 
 The classification is done based on CDR (clinical dementia rating) value. CDR is a 5-point value which depicts functionalities of AD and other types of 
dementia. A patientâ€™s level of impairment/dementia is designated by this score.
+ 0 stands for Normal,
+  0.5 for Very Mild, 
+  1 for Mild ,
+  2 for Moderate and
+   3 for Severe
